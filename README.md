## lab 8:

- Application should implement features from versions 1 and 2
- Should handle setting aside scoring dice and continuing turn with remaining dice.
- Should handle when cheating occurs.
    Or just typos.
    E.g. roll = [1,3,5,2] and user selects 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
- Should allow user to continue rolling with 6 new dice when all dice have scored in current turn.
- Handle zilch
    No points for round, and round is over
